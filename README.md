# COVID-19-Data-Exploration-in-SQL

This is my first project on SQL guided by Alex-The Analyst from YouTube.
In this Project I was able to explore this vast data on Covid 19 which I got it from ourworldindata.org.
I used MS SQL Server for this project.
I used various SQL commands to draw insights from this data.
Functions and commands i've used in this SQL project are:
1.WHERE
2.AGGREGATED Functions
3.TEMP TABLE
4.CTE
5.JOIN
